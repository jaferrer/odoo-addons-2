Database Unaccented Searches
============================
This module just creates the extension "unaccent" in the database to allow unaccented searches.

Notes:
------

- You also need to start Odoo with the --unaccent option or set unaccent = True in the config file for unaccented
    searches to work.
- Uninstalling the module does not reset accented search. You need to manually call "DROP EXTENSION 'unaccent';" on the
    database.
