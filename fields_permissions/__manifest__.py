Fields Permissions
==================
Add a new mixin class, `fields.permissions.mixin`, that adds some parameters to odoo fields, in order to have finer
permissions on what field will or won't be read or written :

 * perm_read
 * perm_write
 * perm_rw, which combine both read and write permissions

Each of these paramters is treated as a new argument to a `fields` declaration, and can take, as value, either :

 * a boolean
 * a function reference (or a lambda function) taking self as parameter and returning a boolean
 * a string, referencing the name of a current model's method. The method should be @api.multi and return a boolean

An implementation of this can be seen in `test/field_permission_tester_example_class.py`

*Note : All fields are still readable/writable for `base.user_root` whatever their permissions are*
