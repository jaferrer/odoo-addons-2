Stock Move Scheduling on Working Days
=====================================
This modules enables scheduling of procurements on working days defined by resources and associated calendars.

Each warehouse can have its own resource and associated calendar representing its opening days. If a warehouse is not
given a resource, then the system falls back to a company default calendar.
When a procurement needs to be scheduled by stock move, it counts only opened days defined by the
applicable calendar.

This module also enables that procurement rules of type "move" be triggered only on fixed days of the week. This is
particularly useful for scheduling chained moves where some activities are only performed on certain days (e.g.
transport between 2 warehouses only done twice a week on mondays and thursdays).

Notes:
------

- When no applicable calendar is found, the module's default calendar is used which sets working days from Monday to
  Friday. This default calendar can be changed by authorized users.

- For a given procurement, the applicable warehouse is the warehouse of the location of the procurement. It falls back
  on the warehouse of the procurement itself only if no location is defined. This is to handle correctly
  inter-warehouse procurement with chained moves where the warehouse of the procurement is the warehouse of the end of
  the chain.
